It utilizes a combination of harmonic analysis, model development, and regression algorithms to generate future market predictions.

## Product Description

MetaForecast M4 Trading Robot is an advanced trading tool developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It offers accurate market predictions based on harmonic patterns and can be used by traders to make informed trading decisions. 

With MetaForecast M4, traders can gain a competitive edge by analyzing market fluctuations and generating future market predictions. The robot leverages harmonic analysis techniques to identify patterns in past market data and uses them to develop a model represented by a yellow line. This model is then used to generate future predictions using a pink line with blue regression lines.

The MetaForecast M4 Trading Robot offers the following features:

1. Harmonic Analysis: The robot performs harmonic analysis on past market data to identify patterns and trends.

2. Model Development: Based on the harmonic analysis results, the robot develops a model represented by a yellow line.

3. Future Market Predictions: Using the developed model, the robot generates future market predictions using a pink line with blue regression lines.

4. Accurate Trading Decisions: Traders can use the generated predictions to make informed trading decisions and execute trading strategies.

5. Discounted Price: The MetaForecast M4 Trading Robot is currently available at a 50% discount, offering traders an affordable and powerful tool to enhance their trading performance.

### Code Explanation

The code provided demonstrates the implementation of the MetaForecast M4 Trading Robot. It is structured into several functions that perform specific tasks:

1. **OnInit()**: This function initializes the trading robot by setting the discount rate and calculating the discounted price of the MetaForecast M4 product. It displays the discounted price to the user.

2. **AnalyzeMarket()**: This function performs the analysis of market fluctuations and identifies patterns based on harmonic analysis. It reads past market data, performs harmonic analysis on the price data, develops a model represented by a yellow line, and generates future market predictions using a pink line with blue regression lines. The predictions are then displayed to the user.

3. **PerformHarmonicAnalysis()**: This function performs the harmonic analysis algorithm on the price data to identify patterns and trends.

4. **DevelopModel()**: This function develops a model represented by a yellow line using the harmonic data obtained from the harmonic analysis.

5. **GeneratePredictions()**: This function generates future market predictions using the developed yellow line model and a regression algorithm. The predictions are represented by a pink line with blue regression lines.

6. **OnTick()**: This function serves as the main program entry point. It calls the **AnalyzeMarket()** function to analyze the market and generate predictions. It then calls the **ExecuteTradingStrategies()** function to execute trading strategies and make informed decisions.

7. **ExecuteTradingStrategies()**: This function implements trading strategies and decision-making logic based on the generated predictions.

8. **OnDeinit()**: This function is called when the program is about to be terminated. It displays a program completion message.
